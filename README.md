# Kalman_Filter
Implementation of Kalman Filter Algorithm to reduce noise and estimate more accurate state of the object.
Tested using noisy sensor data of elliptical trajectory of car.
Used Position and Velocity measurements to accurately predict the actual position.

# Output 
red - noisy input
green - predicted accurate position.
